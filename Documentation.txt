3 Tier Project
---------------------------
GitHub URL: https://github.com/KastroVKiran/3TierArchitectureApp.git

*******************************************
Steps for Setting Up the Project Infrastructure
*******************************************
1. VPC Creation
Design and create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to serve as the foundation for the project infrastructure.
create a vpc with any name
IPv4 CIDR block = 192.168.0.0/22
Number of Availability Zones (AZs) = 2
Number of public subnets = 2
Number of private subnets = 4
NAT gateways = in 1 AZ
VPC endpoints = none

once created, change vpc and subnets names accordingly.

now create 5 SG for external LB, web tier , internal LB, app tier, DB tier
1st SG is web-ALB and allow http and ssh traffic
2nd SG is WEB-SG and allow http traffic for custom and allow traffic from web-ALB SG and add one more rule and http and custom and allow traffic from 192.168.0.0/22 this CIDR only so that it will be accesible from within VPC only.
3rd SG is APP-SG and allow 4000 port in SG and source will be from 192.168.0.0/22 this CIDR, were allowing 4000 port bcoz our react application code is running on port 4000.
4th SG is INTERNAL-LB-SG and allow http traffic for custom for this CIDR 192.168.0.0/22.
5th SG is RDS-SG and allow 3306 port and in source custom for this CIDR 192.168.0.0/22.


2. S3 Bucket and IAM Role Setup
Create an S3 bucket download application code from git-hub and upload the application code.
Set up an IAM role with the necessary permissions and attach it to the EC2 instance.
create a role i.e AmazonEC2RoleforSSM so that servers in private subnet can communicate with each other.

3. Database Configuration
Launch and configure an RDS instance to serve as the backend database.
fisrt create the subnet group from RDS for our custom VPC and select AZ 1a and 1b and select both DB subnet and create.
now create MYSQL engine database and select mysql version is 8.0.35 and templates is free tier , select custome VPC,
uncheck db backup and create database.
$ sudo -i
# cd /home/ec2-user/
 # ping 8.8.8.8    (its pingalbe bcoz of NAT GATEWAY)


4. Application Tier Setup
Deploy application-tier resources, including the configuration of an internal load balancer for traffic distribution within the tier.
create one ec2 instance with amazon linux ami , amazon image is amazon linux 2.
select our custom vpc and private-app-1 subnet and select app-SG.
goto advance and select created ssm role with instace and launch.

5. Web Tier Setup
Provision web-tier resources and set up an external load balancer to manage incoming traffic from users.

6. SSL Certification and Domain Mapping
Generate an SSL certificate and apply it to the external load balancer to ensure secure communication.
Map the domain name to the external load balancer for public accessibility.



~~~~~~~~~~~
Step 3
~~~~~~~~~~~

Go into the following path of cloned code "application-code/app-tier/DbConfig.js" and open 'Dbconfig.js' file and change the things accordingly as shown below;
module.exports = Object.freeze({
    DB_HOST: 'YOUR-DATABASE-ENDPOINT.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com',
    DB_USER: 'admin',
    DB_PWD: 'kastro2025',
    DB_DATABASE: 'webappdb'
});

The reason for having the above info is our App Servers running in Private Subnets should be able to connect to the DB, for that connectivity it is going to use these credentials provided in DbConfig.js file. 

Update the above code and upload the Dbconfig.js file in the S3 bucket of 'app-tier' folder.

~~~~~~~~~~~
Step 4
~~~~~~~~~~~
Creation of App Tier Resources

4.1. 
In this instance we will do the App Server Setup and DB Server Configuration. Execute the below commands;
Install MySQL
sudo yum install mysql -y

Configure MySQL Database
Connect to the database and perform basic configuration: Replace below info with your DB information
mysql -h <DB EndPoint> -u admin -p ----> Enter the Password i.e kastro2025 (this is DB password). If you couldn't connect, there is a problem with the SG of the DB.

Ex: mysql -h database-1.c380a08uukyc.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com -u admin -p

Lets create a database. The database name i'm creating is "webappdb" (This is same name that you should give in DvConfig.js file);
CREATE DATABASE webappdb;

SHOW DATABASES;

USE webappdb; ----> You will see 'Database changed'

Execute the below code as a single code. Here we are creating a table with the name 'transactions'
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS transactions(
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, 
  amount DECIMAL(10,2), 
  description VARCHAR(100), 
  PRIMARY KEY(id)
);

To verify whether table got created or not;
SHOW TABLES;

Lets insert some info into the table
INSERT INTO transactions (amount, description) VALUES ('400', 'groceries');

To verify whether the entry is really created or not
SELECT * FROM transactions;
You will see the info you have written

To come out of the DB;
exit (You will see 'ec2-user' at the end of command line and at the beginning of command line you will see 'root')

Update Application Configuration to with DB information
Update the **application-code/app-tier/DbConfig.js** file with your database credentials.
make changes into DbConfig.js file according to host , user and password of DB and then upload that file into s3 bucket.

Install and Configure Node.js and PM2
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avizway1/aws_3tier_architecture/main/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc

nvm install 16
nvm use 16 (You will see 'Now using node v16.20.2)

NVM means Node Version Manager
 
To run node as a service, we will install pm2
npm install -g pm2 (You will see 'found 0 vulnerabilities)

Download application code from S3 and start the application
cd ~/ 
sudo aws s3 cp s3://demo-3tier-project1234/application-code/app-tier/ app-tier --recursive

Ex: sudo aws s3 cp s3://demo-3tier-project1234/application-code/app-tier/ app-tier --recursive

ls ---> You will see 'app-tier' folder

cd app-tier/ 
npm install
ls ----> You will see 'index.js' file. We have to start that.

pm2 start index.js (You will see the status as 'online')

To verify;
pm2 list (or) pm2 status
pm2 logs (You will not see anything in red colour, everything in white colour you should see)

At the end you will see something like; http://localhost:4000

pm2 startup
pm2 save ---> To save the configuration	

Verify that the application is running by executing
curl http://localhost:4000/health
It should return: This is the health check.

With this we have completed the application configuration.

4.2. Creation of Internal Load Balancer for App Tier

Now create loadbalancer for internal, first create target group 
TG name = App-internal-TG
Protocol : Port = http and port = 4000
select our custom VPC
Health check path will be = /health
now include app-tier instance with TG and create target group

create loadbalaner
Load balancer name = app-internal-LB
Scheme = internal
select our custom VPC
Availability Zones and subnets are both AZ 1a and 1b and select APP subnet 1 and 2
Security groups = internal-LB-SG
Protocol http , port 80 and select TG and create LB.

Goto the downloaded code folder in local system ----> Open nginx.conf file and in the end of the file you will see something like below;
        #proxy for internal lb
        location /api/{
                proxy_pass http://[REPLACE-WITH-INTERNAL-LB-DNS]:80/;
        }

Replace the LB DNS in the above

Upload the updated nginx.conf file to the S3 bucket

This one we are going to copy to the webserver in sometime.
 
~~~~~~~~~~~
Step 5
~~~~~~~~~~~
create one ec2 instance for web tier
name = web-tier
select amazon os and ami is amazon 2
dont chose key pair
select our custom vpc and subnet will public web-tier
and enable pulic ip for it
select SG web-SG not web-ALB-SG
IAM instance profile = select create role of SSM and launch instance.

Creation of Web tier resources including External Load Balancer

sudo -su ec2-user (To work as an ec2-user)    

cd /home/ec2-user

curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avizway1/aws_3tier_architecture/main/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
nvm install 16
nvm use 16

aws s3 cp s3://<S3 Bucker Name>/application-code/web-tier/ web-tier --recursive
Ex: aws s3 cp s3://demo-3tier-project1234/application-code/web-tier/ web-tier --recursive

ls ----> You will see 'web-tier'

cd web-tier
npm install
npm run build

sudo amazon-linux-extras install nginx1 -y

Update Nginx configuration:
cd /etc/nginx (Your are in nginx path)
ls ----> You will see 'nginx.conf' file

sudo rm nginx.conf
sudo aws s3 cp s3://<S3 Bucker Name>/application-code/nginx.conf .
Ex: sudo aws s3 cp s3://demo-3tier-project1234/application-code/nginx.conf .
sudo service nginx restart

chmod -R 755 /home/ec2-user

sudo chkconfig nginx on

To check the output of the App, we can check using the Web-Tier-Instance public IP. But before checking lets open port no 80 with http, Anywhere IPv4, 0.0.0.0/0 ---> Save rules ----> Now paste the pubic ip of Web-Tier-Instance in new tab of browser ----> You will see the app ----> Enter the data in the app and check in DB 

now to access the application through Route53
create TG for external LB and create LB.
attach certificate to LB 
Create Route53 and create a record for LB DNS and now access the application through Route53.


This is about 3 tier architecture with HA and Fault Tolerance.


Delete everything once its done
First delete ASG
Next delete both LBs
Next delete both TGs
Next delete both AMIs
Next delete both Snapshots of AMIs
Next delete DB
Next delete S3 Bucket
Next delete Certificate
Next delete Route 53 record
Next delete NAT GW
Next delete Elastic IP. This came because of NATGW
Next delete VPC
